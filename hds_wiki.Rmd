# Welcome {-}

This is the `Health Data Science` wiki page.

# Setting up Res-Srv-Lin-01 {-}

## Initial setup {-}

First, update the package sources and upgrade the installed packages to the
latest version:


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -yy
```

Install packages needed later in the setup.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt install build-essential git wget tasksel
```

We are currently using the `Gnome` desktop. For a minimal installation run

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo tasksel install ubuntu-desktop-minimal
```

At this moment, it is good to **reboot** to allow our changes to take effect.

We want to use the MAC address for DHCP identification. To do that, add the
following to every NIC in `/etc/netplan/<...>.yaml`
```{yaml, eval=FALSE}
dhcp-identifier: mac
optional: true
```

To prevent automatic updates open `Software & Updates > Updates` and set
```
Subscribed to: All updates
Automatically check for updates: Never
When there are security updates: Display immediately
When there are other updates: Display weekly
Notify me of a new Ubuntu version: For long-term support versions
```

## Home setup 

Many of the key programs will be installed using the `snap` packaging format.
The snap daemon requires the user's `$HOME` to be located under `/home` on the
local filesystem (see more
[here](https://snapcraft.io/docs/home-outside-home)). To do that we need to
bind-mount the alternative home location to `/home` (in this setup users' home
directories are located in the external storage mounted on `/data`). Create the
mount point

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo mkdir /data
```

Mount the external storage on `/data` and bind-mount the actual `/data/home`
directory on `/home`. To make sure these changes are permanent add the following
to `/etc/fstab`:

```
UUID=<replace-with-disk-uuid> /data ext4 defaults 0 1
/data/home /home none bind
```

It would be good at this point to **reboot** the system. 

## Add users 

Add any new users with

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo useradd -m <replace-with-username> -s /bin/bash
```

This creates a new user, whose `$HOME` is located on the external storage and their
default shell is `bash`.

> **ATTENTION:** This needs be done AFTER bind-mounting the home directory!

## Python

To setup `Python` install the following packages

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ipython3 python3-pip \
  python3-dev python3-tk python3-venv
```

## R and RStudio {-}

To install `R` just follow the
[instructions](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/fullREADME.html).

To install `RStudio`, first download the `deb` package from their
[website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Navigate
to the download location and run

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# Need to navigate to download location!
sudo apt install ./rstudio-<replace-with-version>.deb
```

The downloaded `.deb` file can now be removed.

Point the `CRAN` mirror to the local IPCI CRAN mirror by changing the repo name
in `/etc/R/Rprofile.site` to `http://Shr/SRV-CRAN/CRAN`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
local({
    r <- getOption("repos")
    r["CRAN"] <- "http://Shr/SRV-CRAN/CRAN"
    options(repos = r)
})
```

For cryptography install `libsodium-dev` package:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo apt upate && sudo apt install libsodium-dev
```

## Program installation {-}

Install _Pycharm_, _Atom_, and _Chromium_ using snaps. The snap package manager
is installed on Ubuntu by default, so no need to install it.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo snap install pycharm-educational --classic
sudo snap install atom --classic
sudo snap install chromium
```
