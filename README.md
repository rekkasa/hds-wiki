# Health Data Science Group Wiki

**ATTENTION**: This wiki is still in early stage!

To add a new wiki chapter add a `file-name.Rmd` in `wiki` directory and simply
write your wiki. No need to add a `yaml` section`. Once you believe it your wiki is ready to be published, run

```{bash}
make wiki
```

This will output a new _html_ file in the `docs` directory. Push your changes to github and wait for the wiki to be redeployed
